Recommendation to follow: 
1. There is no default return types for methods in Java. In java it is compulsory that you write the return type
2. There is default access specifier for all the  methods and classes as "default", by default it is not "public".
3. Write methods with return statement wherever possible
4. Do not write any business logic in public static void main 
5. You can create objects in "any method", it is not only psvm where you create objects
6. Do not write any business logic without any method. *&****
7. method name should have the task connected with some Nouns
   driveCar
 8.Do not create unnecessary local variables. There are termed as code smells. This blocks code optimization
 9.Class name should start with Capital
 9.method name starts with small letters and should follow camelCase
 10. constants should be all CAPITAL
 11. variables should be lowercase and nouns.
 12. Only one class from entire project contains psvm 
 13. Referece names should come from refernce of class name
 14. Always have default constructor and parameterized constructor(wheereve possible) class
 15. In parameterized consturctor, the arguments should match with the name of instant variables
 16. Every instant varible should be prefix by this keyword
 
 
 
 Identifiers : variable names 
   should start with letter or underscore
   no special characters apart from _,$
   keywords cannot be used as identifier 
   no white space 
   
   
 
 Keywords : predefined words having some meaning to compilers
 
 
Hands on: 
if.else
switch.case
for loop
while loop
do while
break
continue


Rules for Constructor: 
1. Name of constructor should match exactly to the name of class 
2. Constructor should not have any return type. Not even void.
3. Do not call the consturctor explicitly.
